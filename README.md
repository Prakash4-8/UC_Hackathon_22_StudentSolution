The student's solution is a front-end project to store and organize all the information regarding academics.
# Project Name :- Student Solution

## About Project:
This is a front end project created in a 24-hour RevolutionUC Hackathon 2022.
Official Link: 

## Idea behind the project:
During this pandemic situation, we are attending online classes. To access class material we need to visit different location on our phone or laptop which is very irritating thing. When we need to access the syllabus, class link, reference book then we go here and there. So, we decided to place them on one page to make the student's life better.

## What we learned from Student's Solution ?
We learned how to design multiple things using HTML and CSS. During this project, we experienced teamwork, the feelings of working with different people with different skills in a team. We learned how to work in a group, how to share ideas, how to apply all theories to practical use. It was a great experience while working with my friends. We teach each other and we learn too. We learn the use of HTML and CSS in a better way.

## What does Student Solution do?
It provides a platform to organize all of the study material, class links, syllabus, timing, teacher's name, etc. in one place. so, students didn't have to worry of arranging things. We will provide them this features.

## Changellences faced during this project:
1. It wasn't that easy to work in a team on the first go. There were conflicts of ideas and how to do it.
2. In the beginning, we took much time to put our ideas into code because this was our first practical project. Even after writing the code, we were not satisfied and try to add new things.

### Accomplishments
We are proud of what we have done using HTML and CSS. It was a great practical experience and knowledge for all of us. This is what we were looking for. Practical experiences matter more than theoretical knowledge. We are actually proud of what we have done.

## Future Enhancements:
We can add Javascript and back-end to make a more useful project. Besides that, we can add "notes" of senior students and previous year's questions papers.
