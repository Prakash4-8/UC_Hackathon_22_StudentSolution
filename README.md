The student's solution is a front-end project to store and organize all the information regarding academics.
# Project Name :- Student Solution

## About Project:
This is a front end created in a 24-hour RevolutionUC Hackathon 2022.
Official Link: 

## Idea behind the project:
During this pandemic situation, students are attending online classes. To access class material they need to visit individual lectures' profiles in the classroom. There are also have class comment and student doubt, which is quite irritating things. When students need to access the syllabus, class link, reference book then they have to go here and there. They all are not placed in one location. So, we decided to place them on one page to make the student's life better.
## What we learned from Student's Solution ?
We learned how to design multiple things using HTML and CSS. During this project, we experienced teamwork, the feelings of working with different people with different skills in a team. We learned how to work in a group, how to share ideas, how to apply all theories to practical use. It was a great experience while working with my friends. We teach each other and we learn too. We learn the use of HTML and CSS in a better way.
