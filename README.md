# Project Name :- Student Solution

## About Project:
This is a front end created in a 24-hour RevolutionUC Hackathon 2022.
Official Link: 

## Idea behind the project:
During this pandemic situation, we are attending online classes. To access class material we need to visit different location on our phone or laptop which is very irritating thing. When we need to access the syllabus, class link, reference book then we go here and there. So, we decided to place them on one page to make the student's life better.

## What we learned from Student's Solution ?
We learned how to design multiple things using HTML and CSS. During this project, we experienced teamwork, the feelings of working with different people with different skills in a team. We learned how to work in a group, how to share ideas, how to apply all theories to practical use. It was a great experience while working with my friends. We teach each other and we learn too. We learn the use of HTML and CSS in a better way.
## What does Student Solution do?
It provides a platform to organize all of the study material, class links, syllabus, timing, teacher's name, etc. in one place. So, students didn't have to worry of arranging things. So, We will provide them this features.
